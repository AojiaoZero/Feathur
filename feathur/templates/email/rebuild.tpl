					Hello,
					<br><br>
					Unfortunately as many of you are aware we had a hardware failure on S1-NY. If you're receiving this message it means that you had a VPS on S1-NY and that we were unable to salvage the data on your VPS. We've replaced the failed drives and have setup Feathur so that you can login and rebuild your VPS. If you would like we are offering one month of free service for the issue and while it won't replace any data you may have lost we hope that it will give you adequate time to rebuild and setup your services again.
					<br><br>
					It's rare that a server failure like this happens and we understand that no one likes to loose data. We did our very best to attempt to recover the data, but in the end there was nothing we could salvage. This is why we encourage and emplore our users to maintain their own backups, just in case an event like this happens.
					<br><br>
					Once again we do apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions or wish to request the credit for your service please feel free to open a ticket with us at: https://bluevm.com
					<br><br>
					Best Regards,<br>
					The BlueVM Support Team<br>
